<p align="center">Yet another Discord library for bots in TypeScript, with a primary focus on performance and instability</p>

## What the hell is this?

It is just another Discord library for bots, just like [D.JS](https://discord.js.org) and
[Eris](https://abal.moe/eris).  
This is a **work-in-progress**.  

## Why does this exist? We already have so many of them already!

- It exists because I wanted to [have a bit of fun. No, really.](https://justforfunnoreally.dev)
- This also exists because personally I find the generic Discord bot either too slow or bloated
  (D.JS) or has literally illegible code (Eris).

## What other differences does this and other libraries of the same purpose have?

This library...

- will attempt to opt to the highest Discord Gateway version possible.
- will probably receive major breaking changes without any warnings (again this is made for fun, I
  shouldn't have to tell everyone to change this and that or create a warning just because I want to
  push an update).
